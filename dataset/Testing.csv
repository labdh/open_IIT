A reason for the popularity of novels among women was that it allowed for a new conception of womanhood.

In addition to merchants and manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers or administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a person s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas envisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and opportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of Government, Locke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right of the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a form of government based on a social contract between people and their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu proposed a division of power within the government between the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of government was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen colonies declared their independence from Britain. The American constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important example for political thinkers in France.

In the first half of th century they tried to collect maximum land revenue through deshmukhs and it resulted in desertion of lands by peasants and complete decline of agriculture. In view of this situation, the Nizam s government set up a new land revenue arrangement by which the government appointed district officials to collect land revenue directly. The old landlords were compensated with an annual payment called rusum and they were also given patta rights of full ownership over the land and adjoining waste lands and forests. As the landlords realized that there was a large export market for several agricultural products like castor groundnut etc. they brought more waste lands under cultivation to grow these crops. But who will work on those lands? They expanded the scope of vetti or unpaid labour by forcing ordinary peasants and village artisan and service castes to work on landlord s lands. The large landlords were called Doras . The Doras lived in large fortified houses called gadi and had a large retinue of servants and soldiers. They had vast lands cultivated by tenants and also lands directly cultivated with forced labour. They acted as village moneylenders too. They also had judicial powers over the entire village. They settled all village disputes and were usually partisan towards the upper castes. Other village officials like patwaris and smaller landlords too had to abide by their orders. They forcibly ensured that the lower caste labourers worked for all the upper castes and especially the landlords. They enforced such rules like no lower caste person could wear shirts or slippers or wear a turban, and always remain bent before the doras and address them as their masters.

At the same time Muslim scholars developed a holy law called Shariat. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice.

784,784,785,"Rabindranath Tagore (-) developed the Bengali novel after Bankim s death. His early novels were historical; he later shifted to writing stories about domestic relationships. He was mainly preoccupied with the condition of women and nationalism. Both concerns are featured in his Ghare Baire () translated in as The Home and the World. The story is about Bimala, the wife of Nikhilesh, a liberal landlord who believes that he can save his country by patiently bettering the lives of its poor and marginal sections. But Bimala is attracted to Sandip, her husband s friend and a firebrand extremist. Sandip is so completely dedicated to throwing out the British that he does not mind if the poor low castes suffer and Muslims are made to feel like outsiders. By becoming a part of Sandip s group, Bimala gets a sense of self-worth and self-esteem. Rabindranth also shows the contradictory effects of nationalist involvement for women. Bimala may be admired by the young males of the group but she cannot influence their decisions. Indeed she is used by Sandip to acquire funds for the movement. Tagore s novels are striking because they make us rethink both man-woman relationships and nationalism.
